# Reddit MCP Integration Fix

## Problem

The sentiment analysis agent was unable to connect to the Reddit MCP server due to two main issues:

1. Python module import path issues
2. CrewAI tool validation errors with the newer version of CrewAI

## Solution

### 1. Module Path Fix

Fixed the PYTHONPATH configuration to properly include the `src` directory for MCP imports.

### 2. Proper CrewAI Tool Implementation

Replaced the function-decorated tool with a proper class-based tool that inherits from `BaseTool`. CrewAI's latest API expects tools to be instances of `BaseTool` rather than just decorated functions.

The new implementation:
- Creates a dedicated `crewai_tools.py` module
- Implements a `RedditDataTool` class extending `BaseTool`
- Properly manages parameters and tool execution

## Usage

The fix is transparent to users of the sentiment analysis agent. The agent will now properly connect to the MCP server and retrieve Reddit data.

## Testing

1. Created a standalone test script `reddit_fix.py` to validate direct MCP server communication
2. Added a diagnostic tool `agent_diagnostic.py` to verify the agent's `get_reddit_data` function
3. Created a full integration test `test_fixed_agent.py` to verify the fixed agent works with CrewAI

## Implementation Details

### New Files:
- `sentiment_analysis_agent/agent_core/crewai_tools.py` - Contains the `RedditDataTool` class
- `test_fixed_agent.py` - Test script to verify the fix

### Modified Files:
- `sentiment_analysis_agent/agent_core/agent.py` - Removed the deprecated function-based tool and added the new BaseTool implementation
